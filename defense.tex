\begin{frame}{The \lhcb experiment}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item LHCb is the dedicated heavy flavour physics experiment at the LHC
  \item Its primary goal is to look for indirect evidence of new physics in CP violation and rare decays of beauty and charm hadrons
  \item This requires:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Excellent tracking 
      \begin{itemize}
      \item momentum resolution($\delta p/p \sim 0.4\% - 0.6\%$)
      \item impact parameter resolution ($\sigma_{IP} \sim 20~\mu$m)
      \item primary vertex resolution (13 $\mu$m in $x$ and $y$ and 71 $\mu$m in $z$)
      \end{itemize}
    \item Excellent decay time resolution ($\sigma_{\tau}$ $\sim$ 45~fs)
    \item Excellent particle identification
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Linearly extrapolate VELO track to TT
  \item Open search windows in each layer and find $\Delta x$ between track and hits
  \item Scale $\Delta x$ to reference plane at center of TT
  \item Choose clusters of hits consistent with coming from the same VELO track
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[\ding{72}] Each hit must be on the same side of the linear extrapolation
  \end{itemize}
  \item Fit each track candidate with a simple $\chi^{2}$ fit
  \item Choose best candidate track based on \# layers fired and $\chi^{2}$
