  \begin{itemize}
  \item LHCb is the dedicated heavy flavour physics experiment at the LHC
  \item Its primary goal is to look for indirect evidence of new physics in CP violation and rare decays of beauty and charm hadrons
  \item This requires:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Excellent tracking 
      \begin{itemize}
      \item momentum resolution($\Delta p/p \sim 0.4\% - 0.6\%$)
      \item impact parameter resolution ($\sigma_{IP} \sim 20~\mu$m)
      \item primary vertex resolution (13 $\mu$m in $x$ and $y$ and 71 $\mu$m in $z$)
      \end{itemize}
    \item Excellent decay time resolution ($\sigma_{\tau}$ $\sim$ 45~fs)
    \item Excellent particle identification
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{itemize}
